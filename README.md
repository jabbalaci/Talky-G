Talky-G
=======

This version of Coron only contains Talky-G and some
other algorithms. It's not the full version.

Input formats
-------------

There are some examples in the `src/main/resources/sample/` folder.
We support three formats: 1) `.basenum`, 2) `.bool`, and 3) `.rcf`.

The format RCF has the advantage that you can assign names
to the attributes.

How to compile
--------------

Install Apache Maven, then execute the command

    $ mvn package

It will create a `target/` folder where you will find
the executable JAR file(s).

Usage
-----

Here are some examples about how to use the software.
It runs in the command-line.

    $ java -jar target/talky-g-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar src/main/resources/sample/in.basenum 2 -alg:talkyg2

Parameters:
* input dataset
* `min_supp` value (can be absolute or relative, e.g. `20%` is also accepted)

Options:
* `-names` (used for RCF files to show the attribute names)
* `-alg:ALG` (use the specified algorithm)

Available algorithms in this version:
* `talkyg` (Talky-G, basic version)
* `talkyg2` (Talky-G, improved version)
* `dtalkyg` (Talky-G with diffsets)
* `eclat` (Eclat, basic version)
* `declat` (Eclat with diffsets)
* `talky` (Talky)

Further examples
----------------

    $ java -jar target/talky-g-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar src/main/resources/sample/in.bool 2 -alg:talkyg2

    $ java -jar target/talky-g-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar src/main/resources/sample/in.rcf 2 -names -alg:talkyg2

Notice the `-names` option when working with RCF datasets.
If you add `-names`, attribute names are shown instead of
attribute numbers.
